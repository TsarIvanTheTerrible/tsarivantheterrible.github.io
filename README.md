# Vaishnavi singh

Hi there! I am Vaishnavi Singh, a final year student at Singapore Management University. I am a proud Singaporean. 

I study Computer Science, Law and Political Science. I care deeply about AI Safety, and wish to work on both AI Governance and Technical AI Safety in the next 10 to 20 years of my life. 

I am interested to know more about making evaluations better, such that we can find out when and why they scheme. 

I am intrigued by the idea of AI personhood, and potentially acknowledging a silicon-based "being" and what such acknowledgement would require as a basis.

I want to figure out how we can creat red-lines for AI use, and push US and China to agree to them to prevent mutually assured destruction.

I am curious about data centre security and how we should power our AI usage sustainably, whilst navigating rising costs & security concerns and Singapore's unique neutral and non-aligned status.
